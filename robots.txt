# Although not officially supported by the robots.txt spec, some crawlers support pattern matching.
# We don't want crawlers to be indexing pages with an HTML extension (we want them to be indexing the pages without the extension), so let's take advantage of that where possible.
# This will only be a small issue given that we have a canocial tag for most pages, but it's best to play it safe
