We have this challenge:

![Challenge with description "I made a web app that lets you run any code you want. Just kidding!"](https://github.com/colleirose/colleirose.github.io/assets/147954091/380df375-4654-47ea-baf6-dc2ee1aed86b)

The code in `app.py` is as follows:
<pre><code class="language-python">
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import re

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/execute', methods=['POST'])
def execute_code():
    code = request.form.get('code', '')
    if re.match(".*[\x20-\x7E]+.*", code):
        return jsonify({"output": "jk lmao no code"}), 403
    result = ""
    try:
        result = eval(code)
    except Exception as e:
        result = str(e)

    return jsonify({"output": result}), 200

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=1337, debug=False)
</code></pre>

My first idea was to run the regular expression through regex101.com to see if I could find it failing to match anything. I did everything I thought of with keyboard bashing and newlines except for the actual solution to this filter, which was a newline and then the payload. But oh well, I decided that because I didn't find anything on regex101.com, I should check out the documentation for re.match, at https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html

The yellow "See also" box immediately stood out to me and I was fairly sure this was what the solution to the challenge would be:

![Documentation for python re module stating "See also: The third-party regex module, which has an API compatible with the standard library re module, but offers additional functionality and a more thorough Unicode support."](https://github.com/colleirose/colleirose.github.io/assets/147954091/02757f48-a455-4880-a4be-ae1b9b43e742)

I decided to look up `python re.match bypass` and found https://www.secjuice.com/python-re-match-bypass-technique/

![using python re.match() function to validate user input can lead to a bypass because it will only match at the beginning of the string and not at the beginning of each line](https://github.com/colleirose/colleirose.github.io/assets/147954091/c6c7730f-46dd-494e-832a-cb5a816b3167)

I was pretty sure this was the solution, but wasn't quite sure at first how to submit data to `/execute`. I tried just using the Firefox DevTools to send a POST request, but this didn't work because it was looking for a `request.form` input. I then realized the simplest solution was to just create a local HTML file with a `<form>` that links to the target URL. (I accidentally corrupted my Ubuntu install doing something unrelated and had to reinstall it, so I no longer have a copy of the file I used)

This worked and I was able to send code from here. I could have kept going back to the form, but I found it simpler to use the Firefox DevTools "edit and resend" feature instead.

I started by trying `import os` to see what would happen, but got an error:

![Form data stating "import os"](https://github.com/colleirose/colleirose.github.io/assets/147954091/ade1b0db-6213-481a-ade0-509df2839df8)
![invalid syntax (string, line 2)](https://github.com/colleirose/colleirose.github.io/assets/147954091/33198601-219e-41d7-8c5b-e5b985bc6943)

I don't have much experience with Python, so I wasn't quite sure what to do. I started by checking what I can access by referencing `flask`, `re`, and `request`, but none of that worked. One thing I did realize during this is that wrapping your code in `str()` will usuallly show you the exact cause of an error if the response is just 500 internal server error.

I decided to check out the <a href="https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings" rel="noopener">PayloadsAllTheThings repository</a>, because I remembered that its section on server-side template injection had some useful Python code to reference. This did take quite a bit of trial and error, because some of the code simply didn't work and I wasn't sure of the right solution. I ran into errors like this one quite a bit:

![cannot create member_descriptor instances](https://github.com/colleirose/colleirose.github.io/assets/147954091/de7e241f-8a22-4ad9-ac25-67f9082fd2b8)

However, through some testing, I got this to work:
![str(Flask.__innit__.__globals__) listing Python globals](https://github.com/colleirose/colleirose.github.io/assets/147954091/849fcb9d-db7b-42fc-883d-2f1a3dd319b5)

Analyzing the results of that, I found out how to access the os module and the flag:
![str(__builtins__.__import__("os").listidr(".")) listing GNU/Linux root file system](https://github.com/colleirose/colleirose.github.io/assets/147954091/7349ec60-d60b-4c0e-b321-4bc558a5c584)
![str(__builtins__.__import__("os"").listdir("/home/ctf/user/app")) listing app.py, requirements.txt, and flag.txt](https://github.com/colleirose/colleirose.github.io/assets/147954091/15845e29-b1e9-407c-a4d8-f8c976587e36)
![str(open("/home/ctfuser/app/flag.txt").read()) displaying the flag](https://github.com/colleirose/colleirose.github.io/assets/147954091/4cd933c5-c9ca-4143-b808-47df470236fe)

The flag is <code>uoftctf{r3g3x_3p1c_f41L_XDDD}</code>
