We have this challenge:

The code in `app.py` is as follows:
<pre><code class="language-python">
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import re

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/execute', methods=['POST'])
def execute_code():
    code = request.form.get('code', '')
    if re.match(".*[\x20-\x7E]+.*", code):
        return jsonify({"output": "jk lmao no code"}), 403
    result = ""
    try:
        result = eval(code)
    except Exception as e:
        result = str(e)

    return jsonify({"output": result}), 200

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=1337, debug=False)
</code></pre>

My first idea was to run the regular expression through regex101.com to see if I could find it failing to match anything. I did everything I thought of with keyboard bashing and newlines except for the actual solution to this filter, which was a newline and then the payload. But oh well, I decided that because I didn't find anything on regex101.com, I should check out the documentation for re.match, at https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html

The yellow "See also" box immediately stood out to me and I was fairly sure this was what the solution to the challenge would be:

I decided to look up `python re.match bypass` and found https://www.secjuice.com/python-re-match-bypass-technique/

I was pretty sure this was the solution, but wasn't quite sure at first how to submit data to `/execute`. I tried just using the Firefox DevTools to send a POST request, but this didn't work because it was looking for a `request.form` input. I then realized the simplest solution was to just create a local HTML file with a `<form>` that links to the target URL. (I accidentally corrupted my Ubuntu install doing something unrelated and had to reinstall it, so I no longer have a copy of the file I used)

This worked and I was able to send code from here. I could have kept going back to the form, but I found it simpler to use the Firefox DevTools "edit and resend" feature instead.

I started by trying `import os` to see what would happen, but got an error:

I don't have much experience with Python, so I wasn't quite sure what to do. I started by checking what I can access by referencing `flask`, `re`, and `request`, but none of that worked. One thing I did realize during this is that wrapping your code in `str()` will usuallly show you the exact cause of an error if the response is just 500 internal server error.

I decided to check out the <a href="https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings" rel="noopener">PayloadsAllTheThings repository</a>, because I remembered that its section on server-side template injection had some useful Python code to reference. This did take quite a bit of trial and error, because some of the code simply didn't work and I wasn't sure of the right solution. I ran into errors like this one quite a bit:

However, through some testing, I got this to work:

Analyzig the results of that, I found out how to access the os module and the flag:
